#How to examples

### To download  file
```
$curl = new Curl();
$curl->getFile('http://www.example.com');
$curl->file; // this will contain the fetched file

```

### post Form data
```
include 'curl.class.php';
$curl = new Curl();
$data_array['code'] = '55445';
$data_array['session'] = time();
$data_array['zipcode'] = '52415';
$data_array['Submit'] = 'Submit';
$curl->postForm('http://www.webbotsspidersscreenscrapers.com/zip_code_form.php', $data_array);
```
Every form data field have a name and value you wish to submit <br>
so the $data_array **key** is the form field name and array **value** is set to the field value <br>
for examples  <br>
$data_array['zipcode'] = '52415'; <br>
['zipcode']=> form field name '52415'=> form field value <br>

### to get only header response
```
include 'curl.class.php';
$curl = new Curl();
$curl->getHeader('http://www.example.com/');
```
in this case the request method is HEAD and no body is returned
### Submits a form with the GET method
```
include 'curl.class.php';
$curl = new Curl();
$data_array['term'] = 'games';
$data_array['sort'] = 'up';
$curl->getForm('http://www.webbotsspidersscreenscrapers.com/search/search.php', $data_array);
```
### to login using basic authentication
```
include 'curl.class.php';
$curl = new Curl();
$username = 'webbot';
$password = 'sp1der3';
$curl->basicAuth($username, $password);
$curl->getFile('http://www.webbotsspidersscreenscrapers.com/basic_authentication');
```
### Returned Data
All of these examples will return 3 results <br>
##### 1- Contents of the fetched file
```
$curl->file 
```
##### 2- Get information regarding a specific transfer
```
$curl->infoArray 
```
it returns a lot of useful information as an associative array
